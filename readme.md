This is an extended version of the old Tab Manager Google Chrome extension. Should work on both Chrome and Firefox. Malware free, with a new view type and many new features.

## Donations

A lot of work went into this extension for free. Many user requests have been integrated with countless of hours spent into coding, refining and testing of the extension. The extension stays free and is open source - so you can copy it and alter it in any way you want. If you love it, please become a [patreon patron](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=26287710), or [donate to support this extension](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=67TZLSEGYQFFW).

Receiving continuous donations really helps me in investing time into all the different extensions, and making sure that they are not neglected, nor that future browser updates keep them from working correctly. It also allows me to make them backwards compatible, for people on older systems. And of course it helps me in taking the time and brain power needed for developing new features and solving your issues for a long time.

Your patronage means that my work was able to help you - and that's already very encouraging for me to continue. Thank you <3
